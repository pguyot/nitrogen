% Comet in Nitrogen has three moving parts:
%
% 1. A comet function (passed into comet/1) that will generate content 
%    and send it to a middleman process. A page can have multiple comet 
%    functions running at the same time.
%
% 2. A middleman process that buffers new content and sends it to the browser.
%    A page only has one middleman process running at any given time. If the middleman
%    doesn't see any action for COMET_REQUEST_TIMEOUT milliseconds, it will assume
%    that the user has navigated away from the page and die, killing the comet function 
%    above in the process.
%    
% 3. The process created when the browser opens a long-running http request. This 
%    process will ask the middleman for data at a rate of CONTENT_LOOP_INTERVAL for up to
%    INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT milliseconds, and deliver the content to the browser in the form
%    of Javascript.

% How long should we wait for a browser to request comet content
% before we say that the user has navigated away from the current
% page? 
-define(COMET_REQUEST_TIMEOUT, 20000).

% How long should we wait (on the server side) between polls when
% polling the comet function for new content?
-define(CONTENT_LOOP_INTERVAL, 300).

% How long should we wait for the comet function to generate content
% before just returning a blank string to the browser. When this timeout
% is reached, the browser will stop the current open comet request
% and start a new one.
-define(INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT, 20000).
